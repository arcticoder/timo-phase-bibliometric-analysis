### Landmark Papers Detection

**Papers from Target Years Found:**

**1969 (Rudy era):**
- *Phase equilibria in the Mo-TiC-Ti region of the ternary system Mo-Ti-C* - Soviet Powder Metallurgy and Metal Ceramics
- *PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN THE MO-TIC-TI REGION OF THE TERNARY SYSTEM MO-TI-C* - Poroshkovaya Metallurgiya

**1981 (Murray era):**
- *Critical evaluation of constitutions of certain ternary alloys containing iron, tungsten, and a third metal* - International Metals Reviews

**Notable Finding:** The famous Murray (1981) paper in *Bulletin of Alloy Phase Diagrams* appears in our source list (1 occurrence), suggesting it was referenced by papers in our dataset.

### Key Publication Patterns

1. **Metallurgical Transactions A dominance**: This journal published the most Ti-Mo phase research during the period, likely including many foundational studies.

2. **International scope**: Sources span American (Met Trans), German (Z. Metallkd), Soviet/Russian (multiple), and Japanese (multiple) publications.

3. **Specialized vs. general journals**: Mix of broad metallurgy journals and specialized publications (e.g., Intermetallics, Journal of Alloys and Compounds).

### Notable Gaps

- **Hansen (1951)**: Not directly found in Scopus results for 1930-2000 period
- **Original Rudy (1969) AFML report**: Not found (likely because it's a technical report, not a journal article)
- **Google Scholar limitations**: Rate limiting prevented additional searches

### Recommendations

1. **Web of Science search**: When your WOS subscription is approved, search for:
   - "Hansen titanium molybdenum 1951"
   - "Murray molybdenum titanium phase diagram 1981"
   - "Rudy titanium molybdenum AFML 1969"

2. **Technical report databases**: Search DTIC, NTIS, or similar for the original Rudy (1969) AFML-TR-62-2 report.

3. **Citation tracking**: Use the papers found in Metallurgical Transactions A to trace back to earlier foundational works.
